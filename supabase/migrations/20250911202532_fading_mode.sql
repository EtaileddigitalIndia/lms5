  # Fix RLS Policies for Admin Course Management

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policies
    - Create permissive policies for authenticated users
    - Allow full CRUD operations for course management
    - Use simple authentication checks that work with current setup

  2. Tables Affected
    - courses: Enable full access for authenticated users
    - course_modules: Enable full access for authenticated users  
    - module_videos: Enable full access for authenticated users
